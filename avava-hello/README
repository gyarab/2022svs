User creation and administration script meant to be run
as a ForcedCommand when a user connects to hello@svs.gyarab.cz.

A build is just a zip archive of the `hello` folder. You can
run the archive using the standard CPython interpreter.

The main application calls additional scripts. These need to be allowed to run
as root through sudo for the user running the script.
